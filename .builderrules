"Update this existing layout to follow native mobile app design principles. Make it responsive across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Ensure the layout:

Uses mobile-first design

Adapts to different screen widths with responsive flex/grid

Has large touch-friendly buttons and spacing

Aligns content vertically for mobile view

Uses a clean, minimal, app-like visual style

Moves any fixed sidebars to bottom nav if on smaller screens

Ensures text and components are readable and accessible on phones

Do not break existing functionality, just visually upgrade and reflow the layout like a native mobile app."
